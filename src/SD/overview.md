The Prepared food of incision and injection machine
## Abstract
According to the present invention, a seasoning injection pipe is formed on an inner circumferential surface of an injector body to cut a certain portion of cooking food and to inject an additive. A predetermined additive is formed to be injected into a cut portion. In order to couple a cut opening panel on the outer circumferential surface, cutting panel coupling grooves are formed in plural positions. A cutting hole having a blade on one end is mounted. A downward movement adjustment unit is formed at a predetermined position of an operation bar to perform a simultaneous and independent incision work. In addition, a support weight block is installed, and thus a simultaneous and separate incision work is performed. Even though a solid material such as a bone having a different height is present when a plurality of seasoning injectors are moved downward to be cut, it is possible to individually cut and stop a blade without any difficulty. An individual additive can be injected. A known transfer means is provided to repeatedly cut cooking food at predetermined intervals and to inject additives. In addition, the cooking time of a cook can be reduced, and the same operating function is ensured regardless of the size of food. Hygienic cooking is possible compared to the characteristics of cooking requiring efforts. Also, the present invention has an effect of enabling a user to feel a soft food and good flavor texture.

Precise recipe spice dispenser
## Abstract
This Precise Recipe Spice Dispenser is an aid to cooks, providing accurate and speedy dispensing of proper amounts of spices in correct sequence for a given recipe. A transparent plastic form contains a series of separate trough-shaped spice compartments with open faces. The sequence and sizes of the compartments depend on the order and amounts of the individual spices required. The plastic form, when filled with the spices, is sealed to the front layer of a double-layer chipboard backing, such that the open periphery of the spice compartments exactly matches a cutout in the front layer. The back layer has a peelable strip with a peripheral perforation exactly back-to-back with the cutout periphery in the front layer. The names of the spices and the recipe as a whole may be printed on the front layer next to the sealed spice compartments. When the first spice is needed, the peelable strip is peeled back to expose just the first compartment, leaving the other compartments sealed. Subsequently, the strip is peeled to dispense the remaining spices one at a time, after which the strip becomes separated and may be discarded. If the same recipe is to be used again, the spice compartments can be refilled with spices as before and the peelable strip replaced. The Spice Dispenser is then ready to be used another time.

## Title
Dispenser for holding and selectively supplying one of two spices therein
## Abstract
The dispenser holds two spices therein and selectively dispenses one of the spices at a time from a top surface thereof. The dispenser includes a parabolic, oval casing having a top surface which angles downwardly in a central area between narrow ends of the oval. The top surface is formed of two planar members which each engage a central upright and lock to the oval casing in a snap fit manner. Each top surface member includes a recess in the area of engagement to the central upright which creates a transverse slit in a center area adjacent the central upright, the slits being separated from one another by the central upright. The central upright continues downwardly, along the length of the casing to divide the interior of the casing into two sections. Each section further includes a slotted radially upwardly directed flange element extending from the upright across the horizontal extent of the section. The flange element controls the rate of dispensing and assists in returning any unused spice to the storage section of the chambers below the flange.

## Title
Dispenser and method of viewing granular dry matter as it is being dispensed
## Abstract
To control the dispensing of granular dry matter, the upper face of a flange extending from the perforations in the top of a dispenser for granular dry matter is positioned substantially in a horizontal plane and the dispenser is shaken. The granular dry matter is dispensed from the container through a channel in the flange containing the perforations, over the upper face of the flange and observed by the user. The amount of granular dry matter on the upper face may be added to by further shaking the dispenser while briefly tilting it slightly so that the output end of the upper face is below its feed end. The amount of granular dry matter on the upper face may be reduced by shaking the dispenser while briefly tilting it so that the output end of its upper face is slightly above its feed end so that the granular dry matter falls into the channel and back into the container.

## Title
Measuring dispenser of particulates
## Abstract
A device for efficient storage, measuring, and dispensing of several powdered and/or particulate materials holds these materials in a side-by-side array of compartments. Each compartment has a storage chamber and a measuring chamber. Dispensing is prompted by gravity and agitation, for orderly flow of each material through its two chambers as their drain gates are selectively opened. Simultaneously with the opening of the gate under either chamber, a dc eccentric motor acts on that chamber to break up any clumps of material that might impede free flow. Each of the two chambers has its own motor. The storage chamber array is structurally separate from the measuring chamber array, so that the two chambers can vibrate separately, further improving free flow.

Apparatus for dispensing particulate material
## Abstract
An apparatus for dispensing particulate material particularly spices includes a closure portion for a container which may or may not be part of the container and defining an opening in the closure portion. A pair of parallel grooves are defined in the closure portion for receiving a plate-like cover member which slides along the grooves to close the opening. A measuring member separate from the closure portion and the cover member can be engaged with the cover member by a peg and recess coupling and then slid along the grooves in common movement with the cover member to a position where it receives a measured charge of the material. The measuring member can then be withdrawn which acts also to withdraw the cover member to re-cover the opening. A separate shaker piece can also be inserted into the slide grooves to displace the cover member, the shaker piece having perforations so that the material can be dispensed by shaking from the covered opening.
