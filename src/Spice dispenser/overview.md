Dispensing closure for jars that stores the jar magnetically
## Abstract
A dispensing closure comprising a closure base, a dispensing disk, a magnet, and a fastener. The magnet and closure base sandwich the dispensing disk, which are all held together with the fastener. A user fills ajar with items to be dispensed and stored and then mounts the dispensing closure onto the jar with a jar screw band. To dispense the items, the user rotates the dispensing disk to an open position and then inverts the jar. To store and display, the user rotates the dispensing disk to a closed position and then attaches the jar with the magnet to a surface attracted to a magnet. The design allows for manual seal and storage in any orientation (horizontally, vertically, or some other odd angle) and for the dispensing disks to be easily switched. The dispensing closure may further comprise a spacer, which enables easier rotation of the dispensing disk.

## Title
Device and method for coating product
## Abstract
FIELD: food industry. 
     SUBSTANCE: invention relates to a mixing device for coating a food product with a seasoning and a method for coating a food product with a seasoning. A mixing device is proposed for coating a food product formed by separate pieces, such as chips, with a seasoning, containing product dispenser (110) made with the possibility of dosing the falling product flow; seasoning dispenser (120) made with the possibility of dosing the falling seasoning flow; mixing tray (130) adapted for receiving the dosed product and seasoning, which contains a deflecting surface that is the deflecting surface of specified mixing tray (130) and that is made with the possibility to deflect at least the falling product flow to combine it with the falling seasoning flow so that both these flows intersect while falling. A method for coating a food product formed by separate pieces, such as chips, with seasoning is also proposed, including: dosing of the falling product flow from product dispenser (110); dosing of the falling seasoning flow from seasoning dispenser (120); receiving the dosed product and seasoning in mixing tray (130); which includes deflecting at least the falling product flow by means of a deflecting surface to combine it with the falling seasoning flow so that both these flows intersect while falling, covering the product with seasoning, while the deflecting surface is the deflecting surface of mixing tray (130).  
     EFFECT: invention consists in creating a device and a method for coating the product with seasoning, which increase the amount of seasoning retained by the product, provide an increase in the quality of coating the product with seasoning and reduce the time required for coating the product with seasoning and cleaning the device.

The Prepared food of incision and injection machine
## Abstract
According to the present invention, a seasoning injection pipe is formed on an inner circumferential surface of an injector body to cut a certain portion of cooking food and to inject an additive. A predetermined additive is formed to be injected into a cut portion. In order to couple a cut opening panel on the outer circumferential surface, cutting panel coupling grooves are formed in plural positions. A cutting hole having a blade on one end is mounted. A downward movement adjustment unit is formed at a predetermined position of an operation bar to perform a simultaneous and independent incision work. In addition, a support weight block is installed, and thus a simultaneous and separate incision work is performed. Even though a solid material such as a bone having a different height is present when a plurality of seasoning injectors are moved downward to be cut, it is possible to individually cut and stop a blade without any difficulty. An individual additive can be injected. A known transfer means is provided to repeatedly cut cooking food at predetermined intervals and to inject additives. In addition, the cooking time of a cook can be reduced, and the same operating function is ensured regardless of the size of food. Hygienic cooking is possible compared to the characteristics of cooking requiring efforts. Also, the present invention has an effect of enabling a user to feel a soft food and good flavor texture.

Precise recipe spice dispenser
## Abstract
This Precise Recipe Spice Dispenser is an aid to cooks, providing accurate and speedy dispensing of proper amounts of spices in correct sequence for a given recipe. A transparent plastic form contains a series of separate trough-shaped spice compartments with open faces. The sequence and sizes of the compartments depend on the order and amounts of the individual spices required. The plastic form, when filled with the spices, is sealed to the front layer of a double-layer chipboard backing, such that the open periphery of the spice compartments exactly matches a cutout in the front layer. The back layer has a peelable strip with a peripheral perforation exactly back-to-back with the cutout periphery in the front layer. The names of the spices and the recipe as a whole may be printed on the front layer next to the sealed spice compartments. When the first spice is needed, the peelable strip is peeled back to expose just the first compartment, leaving the other compartments sealed. Subsequently, the strip is peeled to dispense the remaining spices one at a time, after which the strip becomes separated and may be discarded. If the same recipe is to be used again, the spice compartments can be refilled with spices as before and the peelable strip replaced. The Spice Dispenser is then ready to be used another time.
